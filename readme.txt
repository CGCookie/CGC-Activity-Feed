== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I customize the activity feed items? =
Each "type" is generated by a filter:
$feed_item = apply_filters( 'cgcaf_feed_item', '', $item );
$feed_item = apply_filters( 'cgcaf_feed_item_' . $type, $feed_item, $item );

= What is the default filter? =
The default filter is
add_filter( 'cgcaf_feed_item', array( $cgcaf_plugin, 'default_feed_item' ), 10, 3 );
This filter treats the element as a link and builds the item as such. Each item can be built individually and customized.
