== Description ==
Customizable Activity Feed where theme and other plugins can hook to display custom activity.

Insert into the feed by calling cgcaf_add_item( $user, $args );

$user: User ID or array of User IDs

$args:
* type: Type of feed item. Default: link (required)
* post_id: If the item is related to a specific Post ID, it's in your best benefit to put it here.
* href: URL for this item
* class: Additional class names for the feed item.
* id: Give the feed item an ID attribute
* image: When using an image type, the source of the image
* content: The text/HTML content of the feed item.
* date: Formatted date of the item

- Keep in mind when using a custom Feed Item Type, with the exception of "type" and "post_id", these vars can be anything your heart desires.

CGC Activity Feed by default ships with 2 activity types.
* link (default)
* image

== Installation ==
1. Upload "cgc-activity-feed/" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
1. Place "<?php echo cgc_activity_feed(); ?>" in your templates.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I customize the activity feed items? =
Each "type" is generated by a filter:
$feed_item = apply_filters( 'cgcaf_feed_item', '', $item );
$feed_item = apply_filters( 'cgcaf_feed_item_' . $type, $feed_item, $item );

= What is the default filter? =
The default filter is
add_filter( 'cgcaf_feed_item', array( $cgcaf_plugin, 'default_feed_item' ), 10, 3 );
This filter treats the element as a link and builds the item as such. Each item can be built individually and customized.
